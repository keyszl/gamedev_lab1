# Diamond Catch

Diamond Catch is a simplistic game for the user to pass time with its fast-paced setting.

The game centers around a cute cat character trying to catch diamonds!

Diamonds fall randomly from the sky while the user controls the cat character.
The cat follows the direction of the users mouse, and once the cat "catches" or collides with a diamond,
the score increases!

The aesthetics of this game are of a 2D cartoon style: a street background, a cat, and diamonds.

One joy of the game was combining the different sprites to make the aesthetic of the game! We think it looks cute.
A struggle was trying to get audio to work properly, which Zoie was unable to figure out, but that is a future update that could be made!

For the contributions to the game, Zoie integrated in the background and diamond sprite, whereas Amelia integrated in the cat sprite. Amelia worked on the score UI and cat movement scripts, enabling the cat to follow the user mouse and working on the half of collision for the cat that would increase the score. Zoie worked on the script for the diamond, creating a diamond prefab and completing the scripts that would make them randomly fall from the sky.
